	<h3>Kelly Services</h3>
	<p>I was working in a project which was about making a better online map of Moscow by collecting more information from the streets. My task was to gather that information by walking along the streets and writing down things that can be useful for users. The job required good communication skills cause it's hard to get in trust of people which were presenting different city services. I joined the project late and it ended after two and a half months.</p>
