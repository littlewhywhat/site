	<h3>Planning App</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/PlanningApp">github</a>
	<p>So it's Java, Android. While planning my self-education, i always have a need in a good planning application - most of them didn't give me what i wanted and that's why i got an idea of making my own. It isn't finished - all that was done is about making a simple app that can delete add or edit events in google calendars - the main part of UI isn't finished yet.</p>
	<h3>Algorithms</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/Algorithms">github</a>
	<p>Java. This project is a projection from taking the course Algorithms Design and Analyses from Stanford. It includes solutions of all programming assignments and a lot of other algorithms.</p>
	<h3>Mia App</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="http://aomiea.ru/">company site</a>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/MiaApp">github</a>
	<p>C#, WPF, SQL Express. It was my diploma project and the first project i've done. There are a lot of things that i hope i'll make different now, but it was my first step and the first project which came to good or bad but final solution. It was made of MIA company</p>
