<h1>Projects</h1>

	<h3>Site</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/site">(github)</a>
	<p>Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jquery, Snap.svg. This site is made by me. It's a first step to a larger and more general project i have in mind. The main idea is to use abstractions for explaining difficult things.</p>
	<h3>Algorithms</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/Algorithms">(github)</a>
	<p>Java. This project is a projection from taking the course "Algorithms: Design and Analyses" from Stanford. It includes solutions of all programming assignments and some other algorithms.</p>
	<h3>Planning App</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/PlanningApp">(github)</a>
	<p>Java, Android. While i was planning my self-education, i always had a need in a good planning application - most of them didn't give me what i wanted and that's why i got an idea of making my own. It isn't finished - all that was done is an implementation of a simple app that can delete, add or edit events in google calendars. The main part of UI isn't finished yet.</p>
	<h3>Mia App</h3>
	<a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/littlewhywhat/MiaApp">(github)</a>
	<p>C#, WPF, SQL Express. It was my diploma project, an app for working with database with UI and the first project i've done. There are a lot of things that i hope i would make different now, but it was my first step and the first project which came to the good or bad but final solution. It was made for MIA company.</p>
