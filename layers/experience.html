<h1>Experience</h1>
<div>
	<p>I am a junior in computer science and i don't have a large experience. It all can be placed in two years: three months of a real job in a small team, one half of a year of working on diploma project and more than a year of studing online and making some programming tasks.</p>
	<p>
		Also i had a job in Kelly Services. It was a temporary project, not connected with computer science, more about presenting a company service to different people.
