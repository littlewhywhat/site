<h1>Music</h1>

	<p> Music is about creativity. In my opinion, it's a little world where by notes you can create anything you want. Like from indefinite number of Lego bricks. It learns you to be unique, to find your own style. </p>
	<p> Here are things that i've made recently. This is a improvised cover version of Testify - the classic tune of Stevie Ray Vaughan, my favourite blues musician.</p>

	<p> Another one is an improvised cover of Steve Vai's Tender Surrender. Make your speakers quieter cause it is louder than prevoius one.</p>
