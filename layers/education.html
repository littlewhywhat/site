	<p>I felt a passion for education not so long ago. Suprisingly, it was just after i graduated. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		Working on my diploma project i became interested in computer science. My interest leads me to coursera - an online open educational platform where i found a Stanford course about Algorithms. Its intructor, Tim Roughgarden, inspires me to learn as no other teacher before.
	</p>
	<p>One of future main purposes of this site is to share some knowledge that i get from such courses and to structurize the things that i learn.</p>
