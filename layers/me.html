	<p>	Hello, I am Roma Vayvod, a young enthusiast from Russia who is excited about the world that we are all living in. 
		<p>	This site is a way to make you excited as me by representing things that i am learning while exploring this world. Today i am mostly about computer science but the most exciting thing in computer science is how it correlates with the real world. Abstractions about which programmers like to talk about have always been used by us in daily life.</p>
		<p>	For today i'll try to make here an abstraction of me like a computer science's resume. Hope you'll find it interesting.</p>
